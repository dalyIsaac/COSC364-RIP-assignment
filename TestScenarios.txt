Test Scenarios
Text to describe basic test cases, expected behaviour and how the config
files will need to be set up to achvie the test.


Notes
Using terminology "cost", noting that cost and metric are interchangable.
Costs are even numbers.
Router ID's are increasing primes.
Port numbers are a combination of this router ID and destination router ID. 
Anything that has a non-prime port number combination is to provide some data
into the route table.

Test Case 1
Start a single router instance with config file R2

Expected behaviour:
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the router id and port
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should end up empty as we are not receving any packets (route info)


Test Case 2
Start two router instances with config files R1 and R3
R1 is directly connected to R3, so are peered

Expected behaviour:
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the router id and port
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received router and port
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should end up with a single route to the other router i.e.
R1 has one route to R3 and R3 has one router to R1


Test Case 3
Start three router instances with config files R5, R7 and R11
R5 has direct connection to R7 and direct connection to R11.
R11 has direct connection to R7 and direct connection to R5.
R7 has direct connections to R11 and R5.
So a simple network ring of three routers.
All link costs are equal.

Expected behaviour:
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the two router id's and ports
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received from two router id's and ports
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should converge to:
R5 has a route to R7 and a route to R11. R7 has a route to R5 and a route to R11.
R11 has a route to R5 and a route to R7


Test Case 4
Start three router instances with config files R13, R17 and R19
R13 has direct connection to R17 cost 8 and direct connection to R19 cost 2.
R17 has direct connection to R19 cost 2 and direct connection to R13 cost 8.
R19 has direct connection to R13 and direct connection to R19, both cost 2.
Simple network ring of three routers, but with different costs.
Link cost direct between R13 and R17 is greater than the sum 
    of the costs between R13 and R17 via R19 i.e. via R19 has lower cost. 

Expected behaviour:
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the two router id's and ports
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received from two router id's and ports
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should end up with:
R13 has a route to R17 via R19. R13 also has a route to R19.
R17 has a route to R19. R17 also has a route to R13 via R19.
R19 has a route to R13 and a route to R17.


Test Case 5
Start three router instances with config files R23, R29 and R31
R23 has direct connection to R29 only.
R29 has direct connection to R23 and direct connection to R31.
R31 has direct connecion to R29 only.
Star network with R29 as the central router.

Expected behaviour:
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the connected router id and port
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received from connected router id and port
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should end up with:
R23 has direct connection to R29. R23 has connection to R31 via R29.
R29 has direct connections to R29 and R31.
R31 has direct connection to R29. R31 has connection to R23 via R29.
