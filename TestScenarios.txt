Test Scenarios
Version 1: 19 April 2019
    Outlined some basic tests, what the networks should look like and
    therefore what needs to be in the cfg files, what screen output
    should be seen, and what the routing table shouod converge to.
Version 2: 19 April 2019
    Added the notes field and version info.
    Started detailing test case 6 (per test example in assignment specification).

Text to describe basic test cases, expected behaviour and how the config
files will need to be set up to achieve the test.


Notes
Using terminology "cost", noting that cost and metric are interchangable.
Costs are even numbers.
Router ID's are increasing primes, per test.
Port numbers are a combination of this router ID and destination router ID. 
Anything that has a non-prime port number combination is to provide some additional 
starting data into the route table. (Note that addtional ports will be opened but
corresponding routes should be removed from the table.)
Timers are mostly set to 5, 30, 20 (Hello, Dead, Garbage)

Test Case 1
Start a single router instance with config file R2

Expected behaviour:
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the router id and port
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should end up empty as we are not receving any packets (route info)


Test Case 2
Process
    A
Start two router instances with config files R1 and R3
R1 is directly connected to R3, so are peered
    B
Stop router instance R3 or R1
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.
    C
Start whichever router instance was stopped
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.

Expected behaviour:
    A
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the router id and port
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received router and port
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should end up with a single route to the other router i.e.
[shown by R<current Router ID>: <destination Router ID>(<next hop Router ID>,<cost>)]
R1: 3(3,8)
R3: 1(1,8)
    B
Either 
R1: empty
or
R3: empty
    C
As per A.

Test Case 3
Process:
    A
Start three router instances with config files R5, R7 and R11
R5 has direct connection to R7 and direct connection to R11.
R11 has direct connection to R7 and direct connection to R5.
R7 has direct connections to R11 and R5.
So a simple network ring of three routers.
All link costs are equal.
    B
Close R5
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.
    C
Start R5
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.

Expected behaviour:
    A
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the two router id's and ports
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received from two router id's and ports
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring
routing table should converge to:
R5:     7(7,8), 11(11,8)
R7:     5(5,8), 11(11,8)
R11:    5(5,8), 7(7,8)
R5 has a route to R7 and a route to R11. R7 has a route to R5 and a route to R11.
R11 has a route to R5 and a route to R7
    B
Notifications of dead time, garbage collection timers, routing table changes.   
Fnal routing table:
R7:     11(11,8)
R11:    7(7,8)
    C
Notifications of dead time, garbage collection timers, routing table changes.
Fnal routing table:
As per A 


Test Case 4
Process:
    A
Start three router instances with config files R13, R17 and R19
R13 has direct connection to R17 cost 8 and direct connection to R19 cost 2.
R17 has direct connection to R19 cost 2 and direct connection to R13 cost 8.
R19 has direct connection to R13 and direct connection to R19, both cost 2.
Simple network ring of three routers, but with different costs.
Link cost direct between R13 and R17 is greater than the sum 
    of the costs between R13 and R17 via R19 i.e. via R19 has lower cost. 
    B
Close router instance R19.
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.
    C
Start router instance R19.
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.

Expected behaviour:
    A
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table.
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval.
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the two router id's and ports.
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received from two router id's and ports.
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring.
routing table should end up with:
R13: 17(19,4), 19(19,2)
R17: 13(19,4), 19(19,2)
R19: 13(13,2), 17(17,2)
    B
notifications of dead time, garbage collection timers, routing table changes.
final routing table:
R13: 17(17,8)
R17: 13(13,8)
    C
notifications of dead time, garbage collection timers, routing table changes.
final routing table:
As per A.


Test Case 5
Process:
    A

R23 has direct connection to R29 only.
R29 has direct connection to R23 and direct connection to R31.
R31 has direct connecion to R29 only.
Star (aka hub and spoke) network with R29 as the central (aka hub) router.
    B
Close router instance R31.
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.
    C
Start router instance R31.
Wait for network to re-converge. Could be 140 secsonds or more (8x Hello + 2x Dead + 2x Garbage).
Observe notifications and final routing tables.
    D
Close router instance R29.
Wait for network to re-converge.
Observe notifications and final routing tables.
    E
Start router instance R29.

R29: 23(23,4)
    C

Test Case 6
As per example in assignment specification - Bring it on!
Process
    A
Start seven router instances with config files R37, R41, R43, R47, R53, R59, and R61.
R61 connected to R37 (cost = 8) and R47 (cost = 6). (Hub with two spokes)
But R37 through R59 are also connected in a ring:
    R37 connects to R41 (1), R59 (5) and R61 (7);
    R41 connects to R37 (1) and R43 (3);
    R43 connects to R41 (3) and R47 (4);
    R47 connects to R43 (4), R53 (2) and R61 (6);
    R53 connects to R47 (2) and R59 (1);
    R59 connects to R53 (1) and R37 (5);
    R61 connects to R37 (8) and R47 (6).
    B

 
Forms a partial mesh network.

Expected behaviour:
    A
cfg file is parsed, validater returns True, router loads config into table
routing table is printed to screen as per the hello timer interval (Always)
notifications shown on screen that packets are being sent to the connected router ids and ports (Debug only)
notifications shown on screen that packets are being received from connected router ids and ports (Debug only)
notifications shown on screen that timer events are occuring (Debug only)
final routing tables ..
R37: 41(41,1), 43(41,4), 47(41,8), 53(59,6), 59(59,5), 61(61,8) 
R41: 37(37,1), 43(43,3), 47(43,7), 53(37,7), 59(37,6), 61(37,9)  
R43: 37(41,4), 41(41,3), 47(47,4), 53(47,6), 59(47,7), 61(47,10)
R47: 37(43,8), 41(43,7), 43(43,4), 53(53,2), 59(53,3), 61(61,6) 
R53: 37(59,6), 41(59,7), 43(47,6), 47(47,2), 59(59,1), 61(47,8)
R59: 37(37,5), 41(37,6), 43(37,9), 47(53,3), 53(53,1), 61(53,9)
R61: 37(37,8), 41(37,9), 43(47,10), 47(47,6), 53(47,8), 59(47,9)
Note equal costs:
R37: 47(41,8) = 47(59,8)
R47: 37(43,8) = 37(53,8)
So it is possible the alternative route will be installed for one or both.
    B
